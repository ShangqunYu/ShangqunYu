### This is Shangqun ğŸ‘‹
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a cs phd student at University of Massachusetts Amherst
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently doing robotics and reinforcement learning related research 
- ğŸ‘¯  I am interested in developing deep RL algorithms that can learn in the real world, and combining learned skills for complex robotic manipulation tasks, but I am also open toother AI related research. My ultimate goal by building intelligent robots is to assist humans intheir everyday tasks, extending their autonomy, and improving their quality of life.
