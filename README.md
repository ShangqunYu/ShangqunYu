### This is Shangqun 👋
- 🔭 I’m currently a cs master student at Brown University
- 🌱 I’m currently doing reinforcement learning related research 
- 👯  I am interested in developing deep RL algorithms that can learn in the realworld, and combining learned skills for complex robotic manipulation tasks, but I am also open toother AI related research. My ultimate goal by building intelligent robots is to assist humans intheir everyday tasks, extending their autonomy, and improving their quality of life.
